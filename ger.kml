At 112212D*OCT09, BSG OPS reported that at 112110D*OCT09, while performing a mounted patrolling activity in PD-10, BSG C/S 11A had made 2 x warning shots at the same vehicle, at grids 42S WD 15490 21706. As the patrol was pulling up along the right side of the road and slowing to a halt, a white 4 x 4 approached from the rear. The two top cover soldiers of the rear vehicle issued both visual and verbal commands, by means of shouting and hand signals. The vehicle stopped approximately 40 m to the rear of the patrol rear vehicle. At that time, members of the patrol were out of the patrol vehicles conducting 5-25 checks. 1 x white TOYOTA COROLLA HATCHBACK rounded a corner swerved around the stationary vehicle and approached the rear of the patrol at speed. When the vehicle was at a distance of about 80 m, one of the two top cover soldiers of the rear vehicle issued both verbal and visual commands for the vehicle to stop by means of shouting and flashing a torch. He also pointed a green laser beam at the vehicle. The second top cover soldier cocked his LMG as further visual force escalation. The car did not reduce its speed and was coming up quickly. The dismounted members of the patrol were directly in its path. When the car was at a distance of 20 to 25 m, fearing for his life and the lives of his comrades, the first soldier fired 1 x 5.56 mm DEU round into the air and the second fired 3 x 5.56 mm LNK RG06 rounds into the ground just in front of the vehicle, which was at that time approximately 10 to 15 m to the rear of the ISAF vehicle. The car failed to stop and another 1 x 5.56 mm DEU round was fired again into the air by the first soldier. Eventually, the vehicle stopped approximately 5 to 10 m to the rear of the ISAF vehicle. An ANP patrol, which was approaching the patrol from the front, saw this happen and approached the suspect vehicle. The vehicle then rapidly reversed up the road out of view. The interpreter got out to speak to the ANP with the patrol commander.

No casualty, no damage.
