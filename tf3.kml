The details of this event are unknown with the exception of the recovery of the components.  It is suspected that Enemy Forces were in the process of emplacing an IED when they detected the CF convoy approaching their location.  As a result, the Enemy Forces hastily left the scene, leaving behind the IED components, as they did not want to have them in their possession, if they were stopped and searched by the CF patrol.  Recovered at the scene was a TC-6 AT mine, two doorbell switches wired via Dual Strand Multi-Core (DSMC) insulated wire to a 9-volt battery. 

Components Recovered
(C//REL) TC-6 AT Mine fragments.  The TC-6 measures 179mm (H) x 273mm (D) and weighs 9.25kg (20.35lbs).  

(C//REL) TC-6 Cast explosive.  The TC-6 AT mine uses a combination of RDX and TNT as an explosive filler.  The NEW for the TC-6 AT mine is 6.14kg (13.51lbs)   

(C//REL) Two (2x) doorbell switches connected via DSMC insulated white wire.

(C//REL) One (1x) 9-volt Battery

WHEN: 261420ZMAY08
WHERE: 42S VB 8095 9789 (500 AGL, SPD Variable)
WHAT: AWT launched ISO a time sensitive target operation initiated by TF 373.  OBJ Pikes Peak commenced at approximately 1330Z, with TF NO MERCY aircraft EDDY 53 and EDDY 57 providing aerial security.  AWT continued aerial security during infiltration and exploitation of target area.  At 1410Z, assault elements were in contact at the objective area and requested AWT support.  AWT engaged targets at 42S VB 8095 9789, but were unable to confirm BDA.  At 1420Z, EDDY 57 observed tracer fire originating from the target grid.  Aircraft did not feel threatened, but re-engaged targets upon the ground commanders request.  At 1445Z, AWT broke station due to inclement weather.  Result: EDDY 53 160 x 30mm, EDDY 57 150 x 30mm.  
TF NO MERCY ASSESSMENT: There have been 0 SAFIREs within 10NM in the past 30 days.  This engagement was a hostile intent Minor SAFIRE (SAF).  The shooter engaged Coalition aircraft in response to AWT gun runs.

WHEN: 122200ZJUN08
WHERE: 42S VB 1931 7254 (300FT AGL, HDG 235, SPD 80KTS)
WHAT: At 122200ZJUN08, TF 373 aircraft were turning southwest (300FT AGL, HDG 235, SPD 80KTS), when the pilots saw a stream of large-caliber HMG/ AAA tracers pass in front of the aircraft originating from 42S VB 1931 7254 and burning out at approximately 6000FT.  The fire originated from the opposite side of the valley directly across from the OBJ.  The MH-47s turned south to avoid the probable DShK fire and made 3 x turns in a circling pattern.  During this time, the tracers shifted to the general area of the aircraft.  The close proximity of threatening fire forced the aircraft to divert from the area to a new location in order to exfil the ground elements.  The medium to high volume of fire and the range of the tracers corresponded to a possible DShK or ZPU/ZGU.  The gun system possibly formed part of a complex ground ambush plan that included an earlier attempted ambush targeting the assaulting ground force with VOIED of the suspected insurgents compound.  The gunner(s) on the AAA gun fired continuous bursts without hesitation at the sound of the aircraft. 
TF DESTINY ASSESSMENT: There have been 0 SAFIREs within 10NM in the past 30 days.  The closest SAFIRE was on 05 JUN 08, approximately 24NM south of this incident, when 2 x UH-60s were engaged by RPG fire.  Although this report suggests that TF 373s aircraft were engaged by an AAA weapons system, it is not likely that there is a ZU-23 (completely overlooked by Coalition Forces) in Ghazni Province.  It is more likely a DShK or possibly a ZGU, which are more easily transported, more easily acquired, and more affordable than a ZU-23.  This SAFIRE is assessed as a deliberate engagement, as insurgents planned to retaliate against TF 373 operations, and intentionally engaged the aircraft once they were at a lower altitude and preparing for exfil.

WHEN: 261900ZJUL08
WHERE: 42S WB 48510 73410 (SAFIRE/ENGAGEMENT 1), 42S WB 47441 73787 (ENGAGEMENT 2) (9500-10000 AGL, HDG 300, SPD UNK)
WHAT: Attack Weapons Team (AWT), EDDIE 57/50, departed FOB Salerno at 261900ZJUL08 as QRF ISO TF 373 IVO KG Pass.  After approximately an hour and a half on station with TF 373, AWT was requested to respond to a TIC IVO Spera DC, 42S WB 48510 73410.  As AWT arrived on station, heading 300 degrees, the aircraft immediately received fire from the ridgelines, qalats, and ground on all sides.  AWT reported there were at least 7-10 RPGs and HMG/SAF from all four sides of the wadi.  The closest RPG was approximately 200m away from the trail aircraft.  EDDIE 57 noticed fire coming from a building approximately 200ft above the DC.  There were 8-10 PAX inside the building firing rounds down the hill toward the DC, and numerous rounds continuing to be shot into the air.  EDDIE 57, after obtaining clearance of fires from GLORY 6, fired a N-Model Hellfire Missile at the building.  There were several PAX breaking off and running down the south side of the hill towards the DC.  AWT continued to engage the PAX with 30mm until the noticed friendlies coming up to the building that had been destroyed by the Hellfire.  At that time they ceased fire until they received another friendly update from TF GLORY.  At that time the aircraft was bingo fuel and returned to FOB Salerno to refuel and rearm.  No damage reported to aircraft.  More to follow on the second engagement.
TF NO MERCY S2 COMMENT:  This incident is assessed as a Target of Opportunity Major SAFIRE due to the complexity of weapons systems utilized from numerous positions.  As Operation RAD U BARQ kicked off on 25JUL08, we have seen an increase of AAF throughout the Spera, KG Pass, Naka and Zerok Districts and their intent to engage Coalition Forces, as well as an increase of VISOBS on operations and aircraft flying throughout the Districts.  Expect to see increased attacks on aircraft as Operation Rad U Barq continues.

ENEMY SITUATION 
 
TF 373 Assessment: The location of this SAFIRE and proximity to vehicles of type and number which would facilitate movement of the entire identified contingent indicates that they were likely in transit and took advantage of the low flying aircraft as an opportunity to engage.  This air corridor is not a typical route utilized by these aircraft or Task Force.  The road they were located on passes thru a village (42S WC 09009 37073) within 3.5KM SW of the SAFIRE location, which could imply a possible destination or point of origination of the unidentified personnel.  The fact that the personnel who engaged the aircraft waited for both aircraft to fly by, thereby facilitating an engagement while positioned in their blind spot, would indicate prior training at targeting aircraft.  Additionally, the speed in which the personnel who engaged was able to retrieve his weapon and acquire his target without having LOS until after the aircraft crested the saddle would indicated significant tactical experience.  There has been 1 x SAFIRE engagement in the last 30 days.  The last SAFIRE occurred 11.66KM East on 11 SEP 08.  

FRIENDLY MISSION/OPERATION

An unidentified rotary wing aircraft was engaged while transiting near
Altamur HLZ, Logar Province.

TIMELINE OF MAJOR EVENTS

At 1210Z, 373 aircraft observed a RPG fired in the direction of their aircraft at 42S WC 07535 34061.  The flight of 2 aircraft were flying at a heading of 360 degrees, 110 knots, 10,000 MSL, 50 AGL, in an echelon left configuration, when the crew observed 3 personnel IVO two motorcycles to their right (East) and two personnel IVO a white flatbed pick-up truck to their left (West), on a road below the military crest north of the saddle (out of LOS of the aircraft).  Approximately 15 seconds after the lead aircraft crossed the saddle they were engaged by a single RPG from approximately their 5 oclock position.  The round passed within 300m to the rear of the lead aircraft and 150m to the front of the trail a/c, resulting in an impact detonation into the mountain to their left (West) approximately 350m from both aircraft.  Crew on the left side of the lead aircraft observed one person reaching into the bed of the truck and grabbing an object which appeared to be another RPG (they did not engage).  The visibility was excellent and amount of lunar illumination was not a factor given that this occurred during daylight</p></description>

	ISRD Assessment: This event did not appear to be coordinated and was an ineffective attempt at a target of opportunity.  There has been 1 x SAFIRE within 10 NM in the last 30.  The SAFIRE occurred on 21 SEP 08 when two UH-60s were engaged with SAF.

FRIENDLY MISSION/OPERATION
	TF 373 RS (CH-47s) were flying an unknown mission IVO Khowst Bowl, Khowst, AF.

TIMELINE OF MAJOR EVENTS
At 2145Z, CH-47s were flying west of the Khowst Bowl when they observed small arms fire approximately 4KM east of the aircraft.  Both aircraft observed two bursts with 3-6 tracers each.  Small arms POO was visually observed at 42S WB 59354 79091.  Assessment is the POO was possibly firing at the audible signature of the helicopters.  Pilots observed a small light just prior to and post SAFIRE.

141830ZAUG09 
42SWB3762080370 
ISAF# 08-XXXX
Friendly Mission/Operation Task and Purpose: TF Lift (-) provides aerial security and o/o CCA to TF 373 NLT 141830ZAUG09 ISO OBJ McKINNLEY in southern Paktya.
Narrative of Major Events: OVERDRIVE 43/46 (2xAH64) provided overhead security for infil of OBJ McKINNLEY at approximately 1830Z.  OD flight observed 1x individual fall.  OD flight provided security and reconnaissance for various Stryker JTACS as they moved towards OBJ McKINNLEY.  OD observed 10-14 personnel armed with RPGs and AK-47s IVO 42S WB 3762 8037.  Shortly after, Stryker 30N (JTAC), said that ground elements were in contact with those personnel.  OD conducted multiple CCA engagements as the personnel moved through the area with good effects.  OD observed a stream of tracer fire directed at the lead aircraft on the first pass.  OD called in AC-130 fire on the location and adjusted it to various locations of personnel hunkered down in rocks.  The AWT continued to engage personnel moving alone and in pairs as they attempted to maneuver on friendly forces.  OD continued to provide security and reconnaissance until bingo fuel at which point they returned to SAL and assumed QRF posture.  Approximately 30 minutes after landing, OD launched in support of another TIC in the OBJ McKINNLEY area.  Once on station, friendly forces were no longer in contact and OD did not PID any enemy personnel.  UAS observed multiple personnel moving whenever OD elements were outbound on their sweeps, but OD could not PID the individuals.  OD provided reconnaissance to the ground force until the MEDEVAC was inbound.  Stryker 30N asked OD and HAWG (A-10) to engage both sides of the ridgeline to provide suppressive fires for incoming MEDEVAC and where enemy personnel were observed on UAS and where ground forces had received SAF from.  OD engaged the positions until relieved by OUTBREAK elements (2x AH64s).  OD then RTB with NFTR.
TF EAGLE LIFT S2 Assessment: OBJ McKINNLEY was believed to be an HQN training camp area.  The raid on this camp will decrease the combat effectiveness of the enemy in the K-G pass area in this critical time period before the elections.

Attendees:  TF Tiger Cdr; Governor Murad, Governor of Kapisa; Gen Najib, Kapsia NDS chief ; Deputy Governor Daud; members of TF 33 stationed at FOB Tagab in Nejrab District

Topics Discussed:

Hafizullah:

Currently Hafizullah, reported insurgent mid-level commander from the Tagab Valley, is under the protection of the Kapisa NDS.  (He may be currently in NDS custody in Mahmood Raqi).  

Hafizullah is not considering entering the PTS program at this time.  Kapisa Provincial Council member from Tagab District, Dr. Monavar has acted as Hafizullahs intermediary during discussions with provincial officials.  According to Dr. Monavar, Hafizullah attempted to immigrate to Iran but has not been able to do it legally.  Hafizullah claims he wants to reconcile with the GoA and can be useful in supporting the GoA / Provincial position in the Tagab Valley.  Hafizullah claims that he would be willing to talk at Tagab Valley mosques and public gatherings in support of the GoA and will speak against those mullahs and elders that continue to expound anti-GoA sentiment.  Hafizullahs sphere of influence includes the Budrow Valley (central Tagab Valley). 

CF and the Kapisa NDS will be meeting with Hafizullah on 28 January 2007 at the Governors Compound to discuss Hafizullahs options.  

ANP in Tagab District:

According to the Governor, the MoI has recruited 150 personnel from Tagab District into a constabulatory force that will begin 10 day training soon.  These 150 officials will then have the initial training to provide extra security in the Tagab area.  One of the concerns is that a number of these 150 men are known Taliban from the Tagab area and are trying to infiltrate and influence this security force.

ANP station near FOB Tagab (Nejrab District):

According to TF 33, they have requested that an ANP Station near the FOB Tagab  be renovated and manned by 30 ANP in order to stabilize the area.  Also, the radio station in Nejrab will be receiving new equipment IOT increase output.

Continued threats against Governor Murad:

Governor Murad reported to TF Tiger Cdr that he has received messages from Qari Nejat, known mid-level Taliban commander in Tagab valley, threatening the governor if he continues to support the CF in Tagab Valley.  The governor has received information that Nejat continues to move between Tagab Vallet and the Kohi Safi District in order to avoid capture by ANSF / CF.  Nejats traditional safe havens in Nejrab and Tagab have not been available to him so he spends more time on the border between Kohi Safi and Tagab.

ANA at Fob Tagab

TF 33 has noted that the rotation cycle for the ANA at FOB Tagab is about every 6 weeks.  They state that in order to be a more effective security force, the ANA should maintain the same personnel at FOB Tagab for at least 180 days and not 6 weeks.  (It is the responsibility of MOD and ETT mentors to determine the correct rotation cyle for the ANA element.)

Weekly PSC

It was decided by CF and Governor Murad that the weekly PSC meeting will be held at different District Centers throughout Kapisa Province and not always at the Governors compound in Mahmood Raqi.

Kapisa PCC

TF Tiger Cdr observed that the PCC is running but is limited in their communication with the District Centers.  Currently, communication to the district level is by Roshan cell phone.  The districts are still waiting delivery of the CODAN equipment by CSTC-A.

Durnama High School- $48,750.00
Dihat Dasht School  37,344.25
Najibullah School  37,259.65
Juldak School  36,625.00
Zikrul Haq Shahid School  23062.50
Aftabchi School  30137.50
Abdul Baq Shahid School  34378.75

These projects are a part of 13 schools recommended for approval by the Governor and the Provincial Council, and the remaining 6 schools will be contracted on 3 February. These schools will dramatically increase the ability for the Government of Afghanistan to educate the populace. The Afghanya Road project, endorsed by TF 33 and the Governor, has been submitted to TF Tiger today. The village of Afghanya has been extremely helpful to Coalition forces since the formation of the Tagab Firebase, and has provided valuable assistance to numerous PRT missions, including several MEDCAPs. This project will solidify pro-Coalition sentiment in the area.</p></description>

Executive Summary from Meeting with Gov Sherzai, (12 0730Z Jun 07):

The following personnel attended the meeting with Gov Sherzai:  Lt Col Phillips (PRT CDR), LTC Milhorn (TF RAPTOR), Danny Hall (DoS), LTC Muhamadullah (Deputy CDR, Unit 03), and Najib (PRT TERP).

Governor Sherzai began the meeting by describing the event as an unfortunate incident that occurred between friends and he further emphasized that he does not want to see this happen again.  Though not completely opposed to night operations, he strongly encourages better coordination.

Lt Col Phillips inquired of any press coverage and the governor indicated that he had pre-taped the following comments:

Afghan security forces conducted a joint operation with Coalition Forces (CF) to fight the enemy.The governor cited recent attacks by TB against police checkpoints, adding that many police were still cautious of any activity in the surrounding areas 

The governor described that the joint patrol was misdirected resulting in close contact made with police from Unit 03.  He indicated that Unit 03 reacted by engaging CF first.  CF then responded when attacked, resulting in numerous casualties. 

The governor emphasized this incident as a complete misunderstanding, again citing recent TB activities within the area and the immediate response to a perceived threat by both forces. 
 
Lt Col Phillips acknowledged the Governors concern and reiterated our support to prevent these types of events from occurring again. 

The governor indicated that he had received $2000 from OGA and he, himself, donated an additional $10,000 to Families/Elders for initial funeral expenses. 

The governor reported that his Deputy Governor, Afghan National Police Chief, and several line directors were already working to prevent any demonstrations.  The governor also reported that MOI and President Karzais office had also been notified.  Governor Sherzai advised that CF in Kabul should host a press conference to prevent negative messages from being used by the insurgents. 

When Lt Col Phillips emphasized the need for continued night operations, Governor Sherzai did not retaliate.  The governor acknowledged that many of the tribal elders and mullahs were opposed to night ops.  He only re-emphasized the need for improved coordination and intelligence sharing. If not done, bad things will continue to happen, he said.

The governor outlined future events to address many of the new concerns:

On Sunday, 17 Jun 07, he will host a Shura at the governors compound  inviting 10 tribal elders and leaders from each of the 22 districts across Nangarhar Province.  The governor requested that a general officer be present from Kabul (originally citing GEN McNeil).  Media will also be invited with no press conference to follow. 
Within the next few days, he will host the Families and Soldiers of Unit 03 at the compound for a funeral service and solatia event in an effort to show how much he cares for his children (the police). 

Lt Col Phillips further expressed his concern about the inability of ANSF to conduct night ops on their own and further concurred with the governors proposal that all operations should be conducted jointly.  The governor responded with agreement and stressed that ANSF should be in the lead with CF in trail.

After the governor concluded with his comments, I expressed my condolences to LTC Muhamadullah and the governor and reiterated our emphasis to conduct joint patrols routinely.  Additionally, I expressed my concern for the derogatory remarks made by LTC Safi, the Unit 03 Commander in Khogyani, and suggested that we meet in the near future.  LTC Muhamadullah suggested that we meet with LTC Safi within the next few days and follow-up with a meeting in Khogyani.

In closing, Governor Sherzai requested that the three trucks destroyed by CF be replaced.  He added that MOI had committed to sending three additional trucks to Unit 03, and at least 30 to the governor for distribution amongst his 22 sub-governors and special staff.  He indicated that he had given four of his personal vehicles to sub-governors, of which all had been destroyed by IEDs.

13 June 07 Meeting with BG Gul Nabi (Director of Education and Training for MOI) who was doing the official MOI investigation of the Force 03 incident.  Key points from the meeting:

Our sequence of events as discussed last night are the same as he received from Force 03, the ANP, and the Governor 
He stressed that they clearly understand this was an accident, and trust between all involved is still strong 
Appreciated our recommended coordination adjustments to ensure this type of incident does not occur again 
Recommended three events in conjunction with this event:  Shura with elders, shura with security personnel, and solitia payment in small group

Security:  (S//REL) The contractor for the 8 Room School in Mata Khan reported that ANP has not shown up to provide security for the workers.  He also said the villages around the school are sympathetic to the ACM.  The workers have left the job and will not return until security is provided.  After talking with General Miakhel, he confirmed that the ANP from Mata Khan did go and try to provide security.  He went onto say, the ANP went down to the site but the workers were so anxious to get home for EID that they said they had to leave so the ANP went back to the DC.

NDS released the Jingle Truck Driver that was detained last week by PBG that was accused of stealing a generator and wood supplies.  The stolen supplies were returned to FOB Sharana and the Jingle Truck Driver received his impounded vehicle.

Received phone call from Governor Khpalwak that Abdul Haid (Waza Khwa Sub Governor) and his PSD were receiving SAF IVO 42S VA 351 788.  The Governor of Paktika also reported that two ANSF were KIA and 2 WIA.  Abdul Haid took the 2 WIA to FOB Waza Khwa in order to MEDEVAC them.  Before the MEDEVAC arrived 1 of the WIA died and the other WIA was MEDEVACd to OE.
PRT 6 met with NDS6 to discuss the Chief of Police situation in Gomal.  After some discussion, it was agreed that Tefhan (the former Deputy Chief of Police under Wazil) would serve as Chief of Police.  At the present time, there is not an assigned District Commissioner since Shad Khan was removed.  When the Governor returns from the Hajj, PRT6, ANP6 and Paktika6 will discuss a replacement.

Summary of Activities:		Unit: PRT SHARANA		DTG: 2007-10-06

Commanders Summary:  (S//REL)     CAT-A Team B traveled to Sarobi to conduct QA/QC and leader engagements.   They are on day 2 of a 5 day mission to assess the Eastern Paktika districts.  The PRT vehicle situation is eleven of seventeen UAH FMC.   Our one LMTV is NMC for a faulty front drive shaft.  However, the parts are on order.  We have four of four MK19s and four of four  M2s FMC.

Political: (S//REL)  The PRT CO, PRT CA Officer along with PBG CA Officer and DCO escorted the Provincial Chief of Police, Gen Mulakhel, NDS 5 Deputy, Nabile, and the Provincial Director of Tribal Affairs (native of the region) to the village of Laswanday in the Gwashta region of Waza Kwah, 36 hours following a TF 373 operation on Objective Wolf (42 SVA 34591 80079) which resulted in the death of 1 child, 1 woman, 5 males and the wounding of 3 others (1 small boy, 2 teenage girls of which one was medevacd earlier).
   Initial reception was uneventful. About 12 adult males were waiting in the area of the target compound. The group took a tour of the damaged compound while another villager was sent to gather the rest of the villagers from the area.  Villagers present indicated that all persons killed or injured in the attack were from the same family. [Leads to further question as to why one individual, the owners son, was found in the rubble with his hands tied behind his back.]
   The village males gathered outside the compound where Gen Miakhel addressed them. There were about 100 in attendance. This is significant in that there were more in attendance today than when we addressed basically the same group at the Gwashta bazaar (1 km down the valley) after an A-10 attack on an IED maker two months ago. In addition, this was a large attendance for an event during Ramadan. Possible explanation is that the villagers indicated they expected the Governor when they saw the helicopters approach. The group was well behaved and polite as they greeted us with no hostility toward government officials, US or PBG forces. 
    The villagers listened intently as ANP6 gave an impressive, engaging speech. Key points included the importance of education, how ACM elements prevent Afghans from attending school while they send their kids to school, how Taliban mullahs misinterpret the Quran for there benefit, Taliban hypocrisy in burning madrassas now when during the mujahadeen battle with the Soviets they didnt burn madrassas, and during the war with the Soviets how the Americans were widely considered Afghanistans friends but now they call them enemies of the Afghans. Gen Mulakhel urged the tribe to band together and resist Taliban aggression so that they wont end up like the family in the compound.
   General Mulakhel was very well received and talked for the better part of a half hour. An eloquent and very effective public speaker, he hit all the important points in addressing this incident repeating many times how the CF are here to help and are helping the people of Afghanistan despite what lies the Taliban may tell them.
   NDS 5 addressed the group for a short while and distributed Neighborhood watch handbills with numbers to call to report insurgent activity (may not have much of an effect as there is little cell phone coverage in the area and literacy rates are low in the area).
    Mulawi Sha Mamoud from Waza Kwah addressed the group. He is highly respected throughout the area and his speech stressed that the fault of the deaths of the innocent lies on the villagers who did not resist the insurgents and their anti-government activities. He stressed if the villagers told government officials about enemy presence in the area, government officials would come in and separate them from the enemy. He did ask the PRT Commander (in front of the group) to make sure they had reliable information before conducting these types of operations. 
   PRT Commander addressed the group and stressed the fact that Coalition Forces approached the Compound on foot and did not fire until they received fire and took casualties (i.e. the CF were extremely careful to avoid injuring innocent civilians even to the point of putting themselves at great risk).
   The District Commissioner, Abdul Hai addressed the group and stressed that he was attacked just last week while in the area and lost three of his soldiers. He chastised a villager who condemned the compound shooting while telling him his soldiers and other government soldiers have no choice but to fire back when attacked. After his impassioned speech about the attack on his convoy, there was little response nor protest. 
   The PRT CA Officer gathered contact information on the sole remaining brother who lived in an adjacent compound. There were two surviving young males (13-16 years old) from the attack, who were not present, but solatia payments for the loss of the children and female will be arranged through the District Commissioner. 
   The Director of Tribal Affairs stayed behind after the event to discuss items with the locals and return to his home for a visit. 

CO Comment: 
   There was a notable change in the attitude of the group between the last time officials addressed the group two months ago and todays event. Last time there were more protests that they were helpless against Taliban insurgents who come in with weapons and take food and money from the villagers. There was little or no protest today, instead, all in attendance listened intently to the officials speaking. These people live dirt poor even by Afghan standards. Im not why there was so little emotion from the villagers at this event. There was significantly more emotion in the village of Nanger Khel, 10 km to the northeast, after 7 women and children were killed by PBG mortars. Being that Laswanday has been the scene of frequent insurgent activity, it may indicate that the locals, while not supportive of this activity, were at least cognizant of these activities and believed it was only a matter of time before this group/family got attacked by Government forces.

Security:  (S//REL) TF 373 executed a HAF raid on OBJ WOLF down in WAZI KHWA targeting the IED cell that operates along Route Viper. BDA is still being assessed; however, this IED cell may be considerably weakened as a result of this operation. The military police were involved in a TIC in northern MATAKHAN. Their convoy was attempting to intercept a possible ACM logistics convoy when they were engaged with small arms fire and RPGs. We believe this ambush was an attempt to protect the ACM supply route from ANDAR to ZORMAT.

FM TF PALADIN
DEVICE CONSTRUCTION AND METHOD OF OPERATION
(S//REL) Construction of the IED consisted of three battery packs, one cassette player and approximately 300 meters of wire. The battery pack was likely connected to the transformer in the cassette player boosting the electrical charge in order to overcome the resistance of the 300 meter wire. The electrical wire connected to the main charge creating a command wire IED (CWIED).

INVESTIGATOR&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S COMMENTS
(S//REL) CEXC BAF did not respond to this incident. There was no investigation of the scene all information in this report has been gleaned from limited discussion with TF GLADIUS. Further information should be sought from TF GLADIUS.

At 0530Z, the SWT arrived on station and conducted an area recon of hilltops for caves and movement.  While conducting security ISO TF32, AZ 52 (trail A/C, HDG 120, 200FT AGL, 75 KTS) received SAF from a compound at 41R PR 6822 3552, 8.49km SW of FOB Robinson, Nahr Surkin, Helmand Province.  AZ 52 was approx 200m away from the compound at the time of engagement.  AZ 56 (lead A/C) observed the SAFIRE, and a weapon that appeared to be fired from a bi-pod, which the rounds were being fired one at a time.  The SWT immediately engaged the compound with 2 x WP rockets, 7 x HE rockets, and 75 x rounds of .50cal.  At 0615Z, the SWT conducted a battle hand over and returned to Gereshk for refuel and rearmament, NFTR. &#13;
&#13;
TF EAGLE ASSAULT Comment:  Due to the rate of fire observed by the pilot as well as the bi-pod it is assessed that the weapon used in the engagement was a RPK.  This was a defensive TOO SAFIRE, due to ground units moving in his direction (approx 300-400m to the south moving north) and SWT previous engagements in the area.  There has been one SAFIRE within 10NM in the last 30 days.&#13;
&#13;
FINAL BDA: 2 x SWT while ISO of OPN THE ISLAND:  13 x EKIA, 4 x IED facilities destroyed, 4 x insurgent vehicles destroyed, 6 x EF fighting positions neutralized or suppressed, and 1 x PPIED destroyed.</p></description>
